## Eat The Frog :frog:

**```"Eat the frog"```** is a phrase that means to tackle the most difficult or unpleasant task on your to-do list first thing in the morning. The idea behind this approach is that once you have completed the most challenging task of the day, you will feel a sense of accomplishment and the rest of your tasks will seem easier in comparison. This can help you to be more productive and motivated throughout the day. The phrase is often attributed to Mark Twain, who is reported to have said, **```"If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first."```**
